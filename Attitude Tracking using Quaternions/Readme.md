1) Since, all the files are of matlab so upload them on matlab and access them.
2) The .slx extension file is the simulation.
3) p.mat, q.mat, r.mat is the dataset for omega_x, omega_y and omega_z.
4) t.mat is the time.
5) After uploading them open the initial_condition_integrator file and run it.
6) After then run the simulation.
7) You can view the graphs by clicking on output scope.
8) A document is added in pdf format which hai attitude kinematics and basic circuit implementated in simulink.
